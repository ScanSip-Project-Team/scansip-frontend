# HOW TO INSTALL NECESSARY SOFTWARES

To open your code of the project and amend it, you will need to install:

## VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VSC)

Can be downloaded from https://code.visualstudio.com/

## NODE

Can at downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en

Using Visual Studio Code you can then see the app on an IOS simulator or by scanning a QR using the app Expo Go
The process to start the project in VSC is explained below in the 'how to start the project' section

# HOW TO CLONE THE REPOSITORY

- in GitHub, you will need to copy the URL of the front end repository to be able to clone it into VSC code.
  For this you will need to your GitHub account > repositories > nudge-frontend (click on it) > Code and copy the HTTPS link

- in VSC code you will need to run the command (replace the element between the \*\* \*\*, and the \*\* as well, by the link copied)

```
git clone ***https://***
```

This can be done for the backend as well if you'd like to review it. However it's not necessary to have the backend open on your computer as the server is hosted on Northflank

# HOW TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES

Once opened in VSC, you will need to install the 'dependencies'. This process is slightly different in the frontend and the backend. Below are the commands you will need to enter in your VSC terminal.

## frontend

```
yarn
```

## backend

```
yarn 
```

# HOW TO START THE PROJECT

To start the project in VSC (after installing the dependencies), you will need to run the following command

```
yarn start
```

you will then see a localhost url that you can open with your browser by clicking or copy and paste.
